If investment is 0, because we are in steady state, then capital will be 0 so consumption will also be 0.
If investment is 1, everything goes to investment so nobody consumes.

as s increases
(1) you consume less
(2) but because investment rises -> production rises -> total production rises

first (2) is stronger, then (1) becomes stronger because the marginal product of capital reduces (mpk = a)
