bai = 100
qian = thousand
wan = ten thousand
yi = hundred million

before these words for 2 you must say liang, but now people can't be bothered anymore

wanwan = yi sometimes (10thousand * 10thousand = 100 million)

when used 0 before these (ling), you omit the bai/qian etc.

ling is asid only once when it is between two numbers, even when representing more than 1 zero:
101 = yibai ling yi
4005 = siqian ling wu
800080 = bashi wan ling bashi

8000 = baqian (no zeros)

chinese numbers are organized between 4 digits:
80,0000,0000,0000
