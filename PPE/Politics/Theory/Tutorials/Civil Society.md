##### Chapter 5: Of the Use Which the Americans Make of Public Associations in Civil Life
Associations are more salient in America, go hand in hand with equality (as opposed to aristocracy where many powerless people can do nothing and one aristocrat can get a lot done, equality makes it so that people need to work together to get things done).

Governments should not fulfil the role that associations do, as it does in France.

In democracies, where individuals are equal and social ties are weaker than in aristocracies, people tend to feel isolated and powerless. Associations give individuals a way to combine their strength to achieve common goals.

"The art of associating together must grow and improve in the same ratio in which the equality of conditions is increased"
