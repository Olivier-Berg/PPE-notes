However there are also arguments that show that they are "somewhere in the middle":
“An implication … is that cabinets in president-parliamentary democracies should be characterized by fewer partisan ministers and a lower proportionality in the allocation of portfolios than in parliamentary regimes but more partisan ministers and a higher proportionality in the allocation of portfolios than in presidential regimes. In fact, this is precisely what Amorim Neto and Strøm find in their study of twelve parliamentary and twelve semi-presidential democracies in Europe during the 1990s” (Clark et al. 2012, 511).

refute this somehow

"Drawing on Clark et al. (2012, 504): Premier-presidential regimes are very similar to parliamentary ones. President-parliamentary regimes are more distinctive, and their characteristics depend on the balance of power between at a particular time. However, the fact that a president-parliamentary country is either presidential-like or parliamentary-like at a time and alternates between the two suggests that this designation does not add much on its own – we simply need to know what the electoral situation is and then treat it as one of the pure types in practice. On the other hand, you could argue that this capacity for oscillation is a unique and important feature of president-parliamentary systems, justifying making the distinction."

"Hmm, though [this paper](https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-6765.00084) suggests that there is debate around definitions of categories too. The conclusion [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1478929919864770) seems to be that there were disagreements over where to put countries, but now there is more conceptual clarity, and so there are no longer (e.g. they’re able to say whether classifications are “wrong” or not)."
