**Essay plan:**
Talk about hybrid regimes, surely it should be possible to say about authoritarian regimes that it becomes *more* democratic.

*We can say a measure of democracy has construct validity*
*if the measure is a good predictor of phenomena that are*
*widely hypothesized to be associated with democracy.2 In*
*the case of graded and dichotomous measures, their rela-*
*tive degree of construct validity will depend upon the*
*predictive power one gains by measuring gradations*
*within would-be dichotomous categories. If changes in*
*the degree of democracy are just as meaningful for "non-*
*democracies" as they are for "democracies," then it makes*
*sense to measure the degree of democracy even among*
*the "nondemocracies." In order to evaluate the construct*
*validity of the measures, I have chosen two domains of*
*study-international conflict and regime stability-for*
*which we have clear expectations about the behavior of*
*democracies.*

-> Therefore, continuous measure is better.

*Przeworski, Alvarez, Cheibub, and Limongi describe this
practice as "ludicrous" and insist on dichotomous measures (Alvarez et al.
1996, 21; Przeworski et al. 1996; Przeworski and Limongi 1997, 178-179).
Their position, which is shared by other prominent scholars (e.g., Linz
1975, 184-185; Huntington 1991, 11-12), is surprising.*

*Przeworski et al.'s argument, which is rep-*
*resentative of the dichotomous view, rests on two logically independent*
*claims-one about validity and one about reliability. Their validity claim is*
*that democracy is first a question of kind before it is one of degree, and we*
*cannot measure the degree of democracy across different "kinds" of re-*
*gimes (Alvarez et al. 1996, 21-22).1 The solution, according to this logic,*
*amounts to the well-known social science maxim to classify before quanti-*
*fying (e.g., Sartori 1970, 1036-1040). Their reliability claim is that, even ifit*
*made sense to measure gradations of democracy, dichotomous measures*
*would be preferable because they contain less measurement error than do*
*graded measures (Alvarez et al. 1996, 31). In sum, they argue that efforts to
look for traces of democracy in "nondemocracies" are
both invalid and excessively error-prone.*

*Second, this choice is important because it affects substantive findings of research on democracy. Although alternative dichotomous and graded measures are strongly corre- lated with one another (Alvarez et al 1996:21), Elkins (1999) has shown that, in assessing the impact of regime type on the initiation of war, a graded meas- ure reveals interesting incremental effects that would not be detected with a dichotomy*...Similarly, Coppedge (1997: 181, 189–97) finds that in cross-national tests evaluating explanations for levels of polyarchy, different results emerge depending on which cut-point is employed in creating a dichotomous measure of polyarchy. Restricting the analysis to any single dichotomous cut-point can thus obscure potential find- ings.

*Among the authors who have advocated an approach based on grading and ranking, Bollen & Jackman argue that “democracy is always a matter of de- gree” and that treating it as dichotomous is a “flawed” practice (1989:618, 612). A graded perspective is likewise adopted by Dahl, using the term poly- archy (1971:2, 8, 231–35; 1989:241, 316–17), and later by Coppedge & Rein- icke (1990). By contrast, Sartori finds that treating the distinction between democracy and nondemocracy in graded terms is an analytically “stultifying” exercise in “degreeism,” which misses the basic fact that political systems are “bounded wholes” (1987:184; also 1991:248). Other scholars who have adopted a dichotomous approach include Linz (1975:184–85), Huntington (1991:11–12), and Geddes (1999). Przeworski and collaborators have speci- fically rejected Bollen & Jackman’s argument as “confused” because it does not recognize that regimes “cannot be half-democratic: there is a natural zero point” (Alvarez et al 1996:21). Their position is especially striking because their larger project (Przeworski et al 1996, Przeworski & Limongi 1997) is based on quantitative data and sophisticated forms of statistical analysis. Yet when it comes to measuring democracy versus nondemocracy, they select a dichotomy*
Collier, David and Robert Adcock (1999)

*Our pragmatic approach also shares important concerns with the focus on “construct validity,” which is one central consideration in efforts by quantita- tive researchers in political science to evaluate choices about concepts and operationalization (Zeller & Carmines 1980:79–81)*

*Central to Sartori’s view of concepts, as formulated in his classic article on “concept misformation” (1970), is the argument that concept formation is in- herently based on classification and that dichotomies are therefore fundamen- tal to reasoning about concepts*
