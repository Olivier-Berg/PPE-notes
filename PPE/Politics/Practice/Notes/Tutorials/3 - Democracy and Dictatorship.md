*We can say a measure of democracy has construct validity*
*if the measure is a good predictor of phenomena that are*
*widely hypothesized to be associated with democracy.2 In*
*the case of graded and dichotomous measures, their rela-*
*tive degree of construct validity will depend upon the*
*predictive power one gains by measuring gradations*
*within would-be dichotomous categories. If changes in*
*the degree of democracy are just as meaningful for "non-*
*democracies" as they are for "democracies," then it makes*
*sense to measure the degree of democracy even among*
*the "nondemocracies." In order to evaluate the construct*
*validity of the measures, I have chosen two domains of*
*study-international conflict and regime stability-for*
*which we have clear expectations about the behavior of*
*democracies.*

-> Therefore, continuous measure is better.

*Przeworski, Alvarez, Cheibub, and Limongi describe this
practice as "ludicrous" and insist on dichotomous measures (Alvarez et al.
1996, 21; Przeworski et al. 1996; Przeworski and Limongi 1997, 178-179).
Their position, which is shared by other prominent scholars (e.g., Linz
1975, 184-185; Huntington 1991, 11-12), is surprising.*

*Przeworski et al.'s argument, which is rep-*
*resentative of the dichotomous view, rests on two logically independent*
*claims-one about validity and one about reliability. Their validity claim is*
*that democracy is first a question of kind before it is one of degree, and we*
*cannot measure the degree of democracy across different "kinds" of re-*
*gimes (Alvarez et al. 1996, 21-22).1 The solution, according to this logic,*
*amounts to the well-known social science maxim to classify before quanti-*
*fying (e.g., Sartori 1970, 1036-1040). Their reliability claim is that, even ifit*
*made sense to measure gradations of democracy, dichotomous measures*
*would be preferable because they contain less measurement error than do*
*graded measures (Alvarez et al. 1996, 31). In sum, they argue that efforts to
look for traces of democracy in "nondemocracies" are
both invalid and excessively error-prone.*

*Second, this choice is important because it affects substantive findings of research on democracy. Although alternative dichotomous and graded measures are strongly corre- lated with one another (Alvarez et al 1996:21), Elkins (1999) has shown that, in assessing the impact of regime type on the initiation of war, a graded meas- ure reveals interesting incremental effects that would not be detected with a dichotomy*
