The second question—_"What explains the success or failure of particular social movements?"_—is likely the better choice for gaining a strong grasp of the material. It pushes you to engage with theoretical debates on contentious politics, political opportunity structures, mobilization strategies, and institutional interactions. Answering it will require you to evaluate different explanations, such as resource mobilization, political opportunity structures, framing, and emotions, making it a rich and analytical exercise.
