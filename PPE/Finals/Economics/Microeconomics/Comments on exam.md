probably just do one essay to maximize the amount of maths, do the strange question at the end of part B instead
easy essay probably externalities, also the question is quite similar, probably good to upload all of the exams into chatgpt and ask which topics come up consistently and in a similar way
i believe, though only empirically tested by looking at past papers that:
- international trade
- social choice
- and like the further reading bits from the other topics
are only tested on part B in an essay, so probably not necessary to revise all of them, maybe only one.
