probably just do one essay to maximize the amount of maths, do the strange question at the end of part B instead
easy essay probably externalities or competition, also the question is quite similar, probably good to upload all of the exams into chatgpt and ask which topics come up consistently and in a similar way. I think information theory and decisions under risk (though i think that these are quite difficult) questions are also very common
i believe, though only empirically tested by looking at past papers that:
- international trade
- social choice
are only tested on part B in an essay, so probably not necessary to revise, not sure though
