probably just do one essay, do the strange question at the end of part B instead
easy essay probably externalities
i believe, though only empirically tested looking at past papers that:
- international trade
- social choice
- and like the further reading bits from the other topics
are only tested on part B in an essay, so probably not necessary to revise all of them, maybe only one
