Last year, Sam Fletcher was wrong about something, so make sure he isn't this year again:
He said that you can't put a quantifier over for instance x if there is already a quantifier over x:
$$
\exists x \forall x (Px \land Qx)
$$
He thought that this was not allowed, but it is allowed, so I think he updated his stuff about it. Though also notice that doing this is useless, the first quantifier does not do anything.
